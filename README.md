# Examples of using the Rvision package
### This is a living repo and the examples are subject to change and sometimes not working

This repo is my stash of code examples using the R package [`Rvision`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/Rvision). `Rvision` is a really great package out of the [Swarm Lab](http://www.theswarmlab.com/) at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](www.njit.edu). This package ports aspects of the massive [`OpenCV` Library](https://opencv.org/) for machine vision into R; a new and needed addition! I started experimenting with this package soon after its release and found it very fun to work with. This repo contains my code and examples of working with the `Rvision` package in conjunction with [`Tensorflow`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) and [`Keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com/) machine learning libraries.

The basis for much of this code is a series of tweets and discussion with the Swarm Lab PI and primary package author [Simon Garnier](https://twitter.com/sjmgarnier). I am not affiliated with the Swarm Lab or the `Rvision` package. Also note, the examples here have a number of dependencies that require some attention. `Rvision` itself requires the `Rtools` toolchain and `gmake`. The `Tensorflow` and `keras` installs range from pain-free to a total pain in the butt.  See the package links above for installation details.
